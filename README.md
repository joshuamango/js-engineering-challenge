This project was bootstrapped with [Create React App](https://github.com/facebook/create-react-app).

## Summary
This is my solution to the JS Engineering Challenge.

This app was build using [React](https://reactjs.org/) and [Bootstrap](https://getbootstrap.com).
The app allows the user to search through the table by id, email, first/last name, etc. and the 
results are automatically updated as the user types. I hope you like it!
